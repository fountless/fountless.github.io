My name is Stu Baker and I'm a web developer for the Center for E-Commerce and Business Analytics and a Business Intelligence Developer for New Dawn Technologies.

I enjoy learning about SQL, CSS, HTML5, SQL Reporting Services, Javascript, Data Warehousing, Big Data, and other BI topics. I also find the topic of Lean and Lean production to be incredibly interesting, and I'm always looking for ways to incorporate Lean concepts like continuous improvement and value stream mapping.

A little about my monikers:

- +1 to BI is a reference to both my inherent nerdliness and my goal for these writings.  Like a wizard in an RPG who can gain +1 to Intelligence, I hope something you find here helps to increase your Business Intelligence.

- fountless is a combination of the words fount (meaning a source, origin, or starting point) with the negating suffix -less.  I like to think it means {" "without source or beginning" "} which is a concept I can really relate to, as I'll often look back and ask "how did I get here?"  I don't think many of us will be able to find a single, defining moment that started us on the path to today.  But that's okay, because the source really doesn't matter.  You are where you are today, accept it, and choose the next step you want to take right now.
