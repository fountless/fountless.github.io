    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>So you just found <a href="http://octopress.org/">Octopress</a> where you can write in <a href="http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax">Markdown</a> and get awesome free hosting for your static html via <a href="http://pages.github.com/">Github pages</a>. But it&rsquo;s built with Ruby and you are on Windows, can you still make this work?</p>

<p>Yes, with a little patience you definitely can! I am just getting my blog up on Octopress and thought I&rsquo;d help by documenting a couple of the <em>gotchas</em> you may run into.</p>

<p>Head over to the <a href="http://octopress.org/docs/setup/">Octopress setup page</a> to give you an outline of what you need to do.</p>

<p>As the setup page mentions, first you&rsquo;ll need to install Git if you don&rsquo;t already have it. I recommend the <a href="http://msysgit.github.io/">msysgit</a> as it comes with a  very convenient Git Bash console. If you&rsquo;re unsure which installation settings to select, see the <a href="https://help.github.com/articles/set-up-git">setup page on github</a> and click the &ldquo;Not sure what to pick on each screen?&rdquo; info box. Then head over to the <a href="https://help.github.com/articles/generating-ssh-keys">generating SSH keys</a> page to make sure you can connect to Github.</p>

<p>Back to the Octopress setup guide, the next step is to install Ruby 1.9.3 or greater. Since we&rsquo;ve got Windows awesomeness going on, you will want to get the <a href="http://rubyinstaller.org/downloads/">RubyInstaller for Windows</a>. After installation you will now have the Start Command Prompt with Ruby which you can run Ruby commands on.</p>

<p>Next clone the Octopress project so you have a local copy and change to that directory using your Start Command Prompt with Ruby. Here is about the point where I ran into some problems.  The setup guide has you install dependencies, so you run:</p>

<p><code>
gem install bundler
bundle install
</code></p>

<p>But if you are lucky like me when running <code>bundle install</code> you get an error about native extensions and that you need the Development Kit.  Head on over to the <a href="https://github.com/oneclick/rubyinstaller/wiki/Development-Kit">RubyInstaller Dev Kit page</a> and follow their instructions for downloading and installing the Dev Kit. After that&rsquo;s done, change directories back to Octopress and run those two Ruby commands again, which should both complete this time.</p>

<p>Following the guide, you are now ready to run the next bit <code>rake install</code> and, of course, that doesn&rsquo;t work either.  If you&rsquo;re like me and <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/q/12400185/1657324">this guy at stackoverflow</a>, you got a:</p>

<p><code>
rake aborted!
No such file or directory - git remote -v
</code></p>

<p>which <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/a/12401196/1657324">the question answerer points out</a> is a PATH problem. Following his link will lead to a <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/a/9793850">short and sweet description on updating your PATH</a>.  The basic problem here is that Ruby can&rsquo;t find git, and you will be updating your PATH so it can find it in the future. After the update, run that <code>rake install</code> again and it works! Hooray!</p>

<p>Now jump on over to <a href="http://octopress.org/docs/deploying/github/">deploying to Github pages</a> and follow the instructions to get your Octopress pages pushed up to a Pages site.  Those instructions are perfect and caused me no problems so I won&rsquo;t bother going into them.</p>

<p>One last gotcha: you will generally use the two commands listed on that page <code>rake generate</code> and <code>rake deploy</code> to generate your markdown to html and push them up to Github, but one other command you&rsquo;ll definitely want to use is <code>rake preview</code> which will mount a webserver for you to view your site before pushing it live.  <a href="http://octopress.org/docs/blogging/">The Octopress docs</a> say your webserver is mounted at <a href="http://localhost:4000,">http://localhost:4000,</a> which it is, but if it&rsquo;s late and your brain&rsquo;s not working right like mine and <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/q/17465404">this stackoverflow user&rsquo;s</a>, you may try that path exactly and wonder why nothing is showing up.  If you deployed to a Github Project Page, the generated files you are trying to see are in /public/ProjectName, so you will need to add your project&rsquo;s name to the URL to see the preview (a la <a href="http://localhost:4000/ProjectName">http://localhost:4000/ProjectName</a>).</p>

<p>Hope some of that helps my Windows friends out there; happy blogging!</p>
