    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<ul>
<li><p>44 questions, with 2 hours provided to answer the questions and a 700 score needed to pass</p></li>
<li><p>To study I primarily used the official training kit (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Training-Kit-Exam-70-461-Microsoft/dp/0735666059">Amazon link</a>) and drew from what I learned on the job writing queries for 9 months.</p></li>
<li><p>Learned a lot from the book, but practice tests on the included CD were WORTHLESS in preparing for the test.  The only two points they helped on 1) Make sure you pay attention to the actual question asked (e.g. if it asks for a <code>MAX</code> don&rsquo;t choose the answer with an <code>AVG</code>), and 2) some of the questions/answers deal with vocabulary terms you should become familiar with (transaction isolation levels for me).  The thing that bothered me most about the CD practice test: its ease makes you underestimate the real test.</p></li>
<li><p><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/learning/en-us/exam-70-461.aspx#skills">Microsoft&rsquo;s outline</a> really does a good job of laying out what to expect.  The areas I really struggled with were a lot of things I use infrequently or have never used: Triggers, transaction isolation levels, XML output.  I&rsquo;ve pasted in the MS study outline and <strong>bolded</strong> parts that I think would have helped a bunch had I been more familiar with them.</p></li>
</ul>


<h2>Create database objects (24%)</h2>

<ul>
<li>Create and alter tables using T-SQL syntax (simple statements)

<ul>
<li>Create indexed views; create views without using the built in tools; CREATE, ALTER, DROP</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Design views

<ul>
<li>Ensure code non regression by keeping consistent signature for procedure, views and function (interfaces); security implications</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Create and modify constraints (simple statements)

<ul>
<li>Create constraints on tables; define constraints; unique constraints; default constraints; primary and foreign key constraints</li>

<h2>Work with data (27%)</h2>

<ul>
<li>Query data by using SELECT statements

<li>Identify problematic elements in query plans; pivot and unpivot; apply operator; cte statement; with statement</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Implement data types

<ul>
<li>Use appropriate data; understand the uses and limitations of each data type; impact of GUID (newid, newsequentialid) on database performance, when to use what data type for columns</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Implement aggregate queries

<ul>
<li><strong>New analytic functions; grouping sets; spatial aggregates; apply ranking functions</strong></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Query and manage XML data

</ul>
</li>
</ul>


<h2>Modify data (24%)</h2>

<ul>
<li>Create and alter stored procedures (simple statements)

<ul>
<li>Write a stored procedure to meet a given set of requirements; branching logic; create stored procedures and other programmatic objects; techniques for developing stored procedures; different types of storeproc result; create stored procedure for data access layer; program stored procedures, triggers, functions with T-SQL</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Modify data by using INSERT, UPDATE, and DELETE statements

<ul>
<li>Given a set of code with defaults, constraints, and triggers, determine the output of a set of DDL; <strong>know which SQL statements are best to solve common requirements; use output statement</strong></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Combine datasets

<ul>
<li><strong>Difference between UNION and UNION all</strong>; case versus isnull versus coalesce; modify data by using MERGE statements</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Work with functions

<ul>
<li>Understand deterministic, non-deterministic functions; <strong>scalar and table values</strong>; apply built-in scalar functions; create and alter user-defined functions (UDFs)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>


<h2>Troubleshoot and optimize (25%)</h2>

<ul>

<li>When to use cursors; <strong>impact of scalar UDFs</strong>; combine multiple DML operations</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Implement error handling

<ul>
<li><strong>Implement try/catch/throw</strong>; use set based rather than row based logic; transaction management</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
